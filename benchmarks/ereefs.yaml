  title: Convert science question to useful data - Part 1
  max_points: 5
  prompt: 'I am trying to model the species distribution of juvenile hammerhead sharks
    based on presence only data distributed along the Queensland coastline. I want
    to model their extent using Maxent distribution modelling. I have 50 presense
    observations, from south east Queensland through to Port Douglas. All observations
    a close to the coast. I am interested in proxy environmental variables that can
    be used in the analysis, including Temperature, PSU, Depth, Turbidity/TSS, DO,
    Chlorophyll and wind speed and direction. Can you suggest a where and how I can
    get or generate these environmental variables suitable for this analysis?'
